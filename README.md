# Pumpkin Seeds Classification

This project classifies two types of pumpkin seeds based on 11 parameters using various Machine Learning models: KNN (with and without PCA), SVC, and GridSearchCV.

## Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - With PCA
  - Without PCA
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open `Pumpkin_Seeds_Classification.ipynb` and execute the cells to see the results.

## Results

The models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
